## Project Name
VINEit
https://github.com/eryulee/VINEit/edit/main/README.md

## Project Description

This app will provide wine enthusiast users with a complete wine guide by typing in the name, type, or category of wine. The wine guide will include the title(name) of the wine, a description, the price, an image, and the average rating.

## API and Data Sample
I will be using the Spoonacular API:
https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

```json
{
"id": 441028,
            "title": "Santa Ema Reserve Chardonnay",
            "description": "Santa Ema Chardonnay Reserva is a bright golden yellow colored wine that comes from the Leyda Valley. A bouquet of ripe tropical fruits emerges, such as bananas and passion fruit along with touches of honey and vanilla. In the mouth, it is a wine of good balance and pleasant acidity.Ideal to go with oily fish and sauces, seafood and grilled crab. Also ideal for white meat and mature cheeses.",
            "price": "$13.99",
            "imageUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441028-312x231.jpg",
            "averageRating": 0.86,
            "ratingCount": 5.0,
            "score": 0.7975,

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| Researching API's | H |  3 hrs | 3 hrs | 3 hrs |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| html/css structure | H | 3hrs|  | 2.5hrs |
| JS | H | 10 hrs |.    |        |
| CSS styling | L | 15 hrs |.    |.         |
| Flexbox/media query | 8 hrs |.      |         |
| PMVP | 8 hrs |.     |.       |

| Total | H | 48hrs|  |  |
